End-to-End Credit Scorecard Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
In the financial industry, evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals is a critical aspect of making informed lending decisions. This project aims to build an end-to-end credit scorecard using machine learning, providing a dynamic and accurate approach to assess credit risk.

Objectives
Data Collection:
Gather relevant financial data from diverse sources, including income, debt, payment history, and other factors influencing creditworthiness.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess collected data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform feature engineering to extract meaningful information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct an in-depth exploratory analysis to understand variable distributions, identify patterns, and gain insights into feature-credit outcome relationships.

Model Selection:
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for credit scoring. Compare models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods to determine the most effective approach.

Model Training:
Train the selected model(s) using historical credit data. Optimize parameters to enhance predictive accuracy and generalization.

Evaluation Metrics:
Define evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC) for assessing the credit scorecard's performance.

Interpretability and Explainability:
Ensure the model is interpretable and explainable, providing transparency on factors influencing credit decisions.

Web Application Development:
Create a user-friendly web application using Flask. Allow users to input financial information and receive real-time credit score predictions.

Deployment:
Deploy the web application on a hosting platform, addressing scalability and security considerations.

Documentation:
Provide comprehensive documentation covering data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, and how to use the web application. Serve as a guide for future updates.

Expected Outcomes
A robust credit scorecard model for accurate creditworthiness predictions.
An interactive web application enabling users to receive real-time credit score predictions.
Comprehensive documentation guiding users and developers through the entire credit scorecard development process.
